title: Racetrack From My Perspective.
---
I've recently uploaded some HD footage I have from my last trackday at Streets of Willow Raceway to youtube.

This is all taken with a Sony HC1 video camera mounted to my gas tank.  Luckily I managed to get some clean laps in before the track got crowded.  This track is so bumpy that the camera mount can't keep the camera pointed straight for more than a few laps!  Oh, and I think I improved my laptime by about 5 seconds from the time this video was shot (the second session) and the last afternoon session I did.
