<p>This is a faithful retelling Canadian odyssey.</p>
<p><a id="more"></a><a id="more-21"></a><br />
On Sunday we left LA at around 5:30 p.m. and headed for San Francisco.  Brady's friend John flew out and we were going to stay with him at his friends' house for a couple nights.</p>
<h4>San Francisco</h4></p>

Lori and Sheryl lived in a converted garage right in the middle of SF.  The front door was literally a hold cut in a garage door with a normal door nailed in.  Women's apartments are almost always more comfortable.  However, once three dudes showed up the toilet broke in a matter of hours.<br />

After following Brady's directions we realize that we've walked 4 miles in the wrong direction.  The goal is to have dinner with John's friend Angie.  At a bar called Zebra Zanzibar Angie shows her true colors and tells us about the fairies she's seen in the woods and even gives us directions on how to get there.<br />

<h4>Redwoods</h4><br />
We couldn't find any fairies but we did find some big trees in the Redwood forests.<br />

Roadside logger stops make some kick-ass chili dogs.</p>
<h4>Oregon</h4><br />
We grew up in Eugene, Oregon so we decided to check out the old hood.</p>

<h4>Seattle</h4><br />
Seattle was interesting.<br />

<a href="http://www.jenwoodmusic.com">Jen Wood</a> kept us company and threw us in the pre-release showing of Star Wars.  Check out her site for some mellow music.  Oh, and make sure you bring a shotgun if you plan on being in downtown Seattle after 2am - it's riddled with what are apparently zombies.</p>
<h4>Vancouver</h4><br />
Drug dealing, prostitution, homeless!  Are these things you associate with good old Canada?  Me neither, until I went there.  Free health care apparently doesn't work so well.  The park was nice.</p>

<h4>Race Home</h4><br />
Ok, so maybe I put the e-brake on 10% or so by accident.  And just maybe we thought there was a problem with the car.  And maybe we almost called a mechanic.<br />

It was a long drive home.<br />
