This is a faithful retelling Canadian odyssey.

On Sunday we left LA at around 5:30 p.m. and headed for San Francisco.  Brady's friend John flew out and we were going to stay with him at his friends' house for a couple nights.

### San Francisco

Lori and Sheryl lived in a converted garage right in the middle of SF.  The front door was literally a hold cut in a garage door with a normal door nailed in.  Women's apartments are almost always more comfortable.  However, once three dudes showed up the toilet broke in a matter of hours.

After following Brady's directions we realize that we've walked 4 miles in the wrong direction.  The goal is to have dinner with John's friend Angie.  At a bar called Zebra Zanzibar Angie shows her true colors and tells us about the fairies she's seen in the woods and even gives us directions on how to get there.<br />

### Redwoods

We couldn't find any fairies but we did find some big trees in the Redwood forests.

Roadside logger stops make some kick-ass chili dogs.

### Oregon

We grew up in Eugene, Oregon so we decided to check out the old hood.

### Seattle

Seattle was interesting.

[Jen Wood](http://www.jenwoodmusic.com) kept us company and threw us in the pre-release showing of Star Wars.  Check out her site for some mellow music.  Oh, and make sure you bring a shotgun if you plan on being in downtown Seattle after 2am - it's riddled with what are apparently zombies.

### Vancouver

Drug dealing, prostitution, homeless!  Are these things you associate with good old Canada?  Me neither, until I went there.  Free health care apparently doesn't work so well.  The park was nice.

### Race Home
Ok, so maybe I put the e-brake on 10% or so by accident.  And just maybe we thought there was a problem with the car.  And maybe we almost called a mechanic.

It was a long drive home.
