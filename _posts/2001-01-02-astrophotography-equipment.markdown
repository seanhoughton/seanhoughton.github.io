<h3>Takahashi FS102 Refractor</h3><br />
[caption id="attachment_240" align="alignleft" width="104" caption="Warning"]<img class="size-full wp-image-240 " title="0005_dontlookatsun" src="{{site.url_root}}/assets/data/wp/wp/2008/12/0005_dontlookatsun.jpg" alt="0005_dontlookatsun" width="104" height="132" />[/caption]</p>
<p>This Apochromatic telescope provides very sharp images with no color fringed stars. &Acirc;&nbsp;When reduced to F/5.9 you get about 3 degrees of coverage in the sky. &Acirc;&nbsp;I prefer to take pictures of large, wide field objects and this is just about the right focal length for those objects. I also use the extremely well made Takahashi camera angle adjuster to make framing easy.</p>
<p>I use a collection of camera bodies and lenses along with the telescope tube for pictures. &Acirc;&nbsp;Many objects are too large to frame in the telescope and a normal 100mm to 300mm telephoto lense will frame them perfectly.</p>
<p>The earth rotates and you need some way of counter-rotating so the stars don't make trails in the long exposures. &Acirc;&nbsp;I use the Losmandy G11 mount which has been modified slightly. &Acirc;&nbsp;Even the best mount and alignment doesn't give the required precision so I use an STV auto-guider. &Acirc;&nbsp;This autoguider does all the work for you and doesn't require you to bring a computer along.</p>
<p>&Acirc;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Losmandy G11 Mount</h3></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="{{site.url_root}}/assets/data/wp/wp/2008/12/0007_sideviewfull.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-242" title="0007_sideviewfull" src="http://blog.mungosmash.com/wp-content/uploads/2001/01/0007_sideviewfull-225x300.jpg" alt="0007_sideviewfull" width="225" height="300" /></a></p></p>
<p>The Losmandy G11 is a well made german equatorial mount. &Acirc;&nbsp;I've made some modifications to it to help with tracking (and because it was fun to do!) but stock it does a very good job. &Acirc;&nbsp;Losmandy makes a lot of adapters so it's easy to connect any tube or tubes.</p>

<h3>Cameras and Lenses</h3><br />
I have multiple cameras that I've used over the last 10 years including film SLRs, cooled astrophotography CCDs and standard digital SLRs. &Acirc;&nbsp;These are the cameras that I still use for astrophotography.</p>
<h4>Pentax K-1000 Film Body</h4><br />
The Pentax is a trusy film body that I used with E200 slide film and other various negative films. &Acirc;&nbsp;It's sturdy and doesn't have any electronic parts to break.</p>

</tbody></table></p>
<h4>Canon 10D Body</h4><br />
The 10D is a great DSLR that I've only recently started using for astrophotography. &Acirc;&nbsp;It isn't very sensitive to red light because of the filtering and it's fairly noisey, but it still does an amazing job with long exposures.</p>

<h4>Canon 5D Mark II Body</h4><br />
The Canon 5D Mark II is a monster 21 megapixel DSLR. &Acirc;&nbsp;It is extremely sensitive to light and has very low noise, even for a non-cooled camera.</p>

<strong>Eyepieces</strong></p>
<p>I don't do a lot of visual observing, but when I do it's nice to have a range of high-power and wide-field eyepieces.</p>
