  Noel Llopis and I did a lecture at the Game Developer Conference this year about test driven development.  It's a process we're using at High Moon and I use at home for all my coding.  Gamasutra wrote <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20060322/duffy_01.shtml">an article about it</a>, but they're the ones throwing the conference so it's not unexpected.

I didn't realize how much work it takes to put together an hour lecture.  In general is was pretty stressful, but worth doing.  The talk went pretty well and I got away without any thrown fruit.  We had a lot of questions and people seemed to be really excited to try out TDD.  Noel has posted <a href="http://www.gamesfromwithin.com/articles/0603/000107.html">our paper</a> on his site.
