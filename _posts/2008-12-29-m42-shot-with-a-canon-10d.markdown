<p>It's been at least three years since I've done any astrophotograpy but last night I lugged out the equipment and shot a few frames.  I only made it out as far as the driveway and the sky isn't very dark in northern San Diego but it's amazing what kind of results you can get with a Canon 10D. &Acirc;&nbsp;Traditionally you would use either slide film or a cooled, black and white CCD sensor.</p>
<p>This is the result of 7 stacked images ranging from seconds to 5 minutes,&Acirc;&nbsp;totaling&Acirc;&nbsp;around 20 minutes of exposure. &Acirc;&nbsp;The core of the nebula is from a single 30 second shot.</p>

Compare this with my best M42 shot on film a few years ago. &Acirc;&nbsp;This picture was taken at a dark sky site using two 45 minute exposures on Kodak Supra 400 film. &Acirc;&nbsp;The Supra has a much better red response than the 10D but otherwise they are fairly similar in quality.</p>
