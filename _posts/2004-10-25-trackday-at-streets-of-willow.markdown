<p>First trackday!  Many more followed, but this is the one that started it all.</p>
<p><a href="{{site.url_root}}/assets/data/wp/wp/2004/10/StreetsOfWillow_08.jpeg"><img src="{{site.url_root}}/assets/data/wp/wp/2004/10/StreetsOfWillow_08.jpeg" alt="" title="StreetsOfWillow_08" width="500" height="395" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-738" /></a></p>

I started out on Saturday trying to load my bike onto the trailer using a dirtbike ramp by myself.  I ended up turning it on halfway up the ramp and gassing it onto the trailer.  It wasn't a pretty site and plenty of people decided to stop and watch instead of help.  I finally made it to Adam's house and his roommate helped me load his bike.  Then is was off to Joel's place where he helped load his own bike.  Stephane's house was last on the list and finally everything was ready.</p>

<p>We stayed in a hotel by Edwards Air Force Base and got up early in the morning in order to make it to the track by 7am.  (We've now learned that you can slack until around 8 for most trackdays).</p>
<p>Joel's bike was broken.  His throttle was binding and wouldn't return to idle after a rev.  He spent half the day tearing apart his bike trying to find the problem.  We finally figured out that we had crushed part of the grip while loading it onto the trailer.  After some minor bashing it was acceptable again.</p>

<p>One of the guys in the pit next to us crashed on the last session.  He helped them load his bike on to the truck and drove in to the pits.  After a few minutes he mentioned that his shoulder was a bit sore.  After some questions I realized that he had broken his collar bone.  I got him some ice and told him to hit the hospital.  I ran into his friend a few times in San Diego afterwards and found out that he had broken the bone in two places as well as broken a few ribs.  Ouch.</p>
