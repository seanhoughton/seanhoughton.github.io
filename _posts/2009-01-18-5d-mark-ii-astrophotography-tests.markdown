There have been a lot of reports of the 5D's trouble with bright point lights. I recently updated to the new firmware (version 1.0.7) and took some test shots with the 5D Mark II and a Takahashi FS102 refractor. I also wanted to test out the sensitivity at various ISO values. All these pictures were taken from my driveway on a day with fairly bad seeing and transparency. I got out a ladder and threw a blanket over one of the street lights but it didn't help much with the sky glow.

### Raw Images
All the close up images come from a tiny portion of three of these four images, each 160 second exposures. The 6400 ISO image was so blown out I couldn't use any of it.

### Noise Results
The difference in noise between the 400 ISO image and the 1600 ISO image is barely noticable.

<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-359 aligncenter" title="iso-zoom-comparison" src="{{site.url_root}}/assets/data/2009/01/iso-zoom-comparison.jpg" alt="iso-zoom-comparison" width="282" height="846" />


### 'Black Dot' Artifacts

<p style="text-align: left;">I created a difference image to compare the saturated stars at 400 ISO and at 1600 ISO and I don't see any evidence of black dots or white, median filtered dots. It could be that this only happens at very high ISO levels. This is a releif because I don't plan on imaging above 1600 ISO with this camera.


<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-358 aligncenter" title="iso-diff" src="{{site.url_root}}/assets/data/2009/01/iso-diff.jpg" alt="iso-diff" width="303" height="303" />


### Process
These are straight out of the camera with no manual processing.

<ol>
<li>Captured in full resolution RAW format</li>
<li>Converted to 16bit PSD with Aperture (no adjustments)</li>
<li>Scaled and cropped in Photoshop CS3</li>
<li>Exported to JPG in Photoshop CS3</li><br />
</ol><br />
The only chance for change would be Aperture's RAW handling, which probably does do some noise reduction, and Photoshop's JPG compression.
