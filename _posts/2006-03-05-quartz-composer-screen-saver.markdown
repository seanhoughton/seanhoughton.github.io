  I've just discovered the Quartz Composer.  It's a graphical tool for rendering things.  You can use it to build all sorts of cool stuff.  My first project was to build a 3D clock - seriously boring.  So I've uploaded a screen saver I just finished.  I tried to do an optimization pass on it, but it still grinds both my dual G5 and MacBook to a measly 20fps.  Regardless, it manages to look good.  Here's a link for the download:
