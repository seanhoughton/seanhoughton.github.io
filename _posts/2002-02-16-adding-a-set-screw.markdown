<p>I have always been irritated that most adapters and extension tubes only come with a single set screw. This not only feels insecure when holding expensive eyepieces, but also allows excessive play burring astrophotography. I'm usually chicken about drilling into my equipment, but I finally added a second set screw to all my adapters and thought I would share my experience for anyone else who may want to do the same.</p>
<p>This is a simple walkthrough of how to add a second set screw to eyepiece adapter and extension tubes.</p>
<h3>Stuff you need</h3><br />
Locate some acceptable thumb screws - mine ended up being 10-32 size. The "10" is the width and the "32" is the pitch of the threads. Locate a drill bit and tap (sold as a package) which are rated at the same size as your thumb screws. I also got a tap handle (a "T" shaped device for turning the tap). The total cost should be less than $15. This assumes you already have an electric drill.</p>

<p><strong>Now for the drilling</strong></p>
<p>I placed the second set screw at 120 degrees from the original. Using the drill bit supplied with the tap drill a pilot hole in the adapter with an electric drill (be sure to make the hole perpendicular to the surface). Put the tap in the tap handle and spray a little WD40 on the tap for good luck. Slowly but deliberately screw the tap into the hole you just drilled. After a few turns back the tap out of the hole and clean out any metal bits. Reapply some WD40 and tap a little deeper this time. Repeat this until you have tapped the entire hole. That's it! After adding the second set screw all your stuff should stay secure with no wobble.</p>

<p>Tip: Clay Kessler recommends white Crisco shortening for lubricating the tap instead of WD40.</p>
<p>Tip: Frank Loch suggests adding a depression for an even more secure fit:</p>
<ol>
<li>After drilling and tapping, insert the set screw into the tapped hole.</li>
<li>Slide the adapter (etc.) onto the object it will attach to.</li>
<li>Tighten the set screw enough to mark its spot on the object.</li>
<li>Remove the object, center punch the now visible mark, and with a slightly larger drill bit than used to drill the tapped hole, counter bore the object just a little to leave a conical depression in it. Now when you attach to the object the set screw(s) will penetrate the conical depression a bit. This will prevent the two objects from ever separating even if all the set screws become a little loose.</li><br />
</ol><br />
Tip: Fred Lusen suggests adding a chamfer to increase the strength of the threads. Countersinks for doing this can be bought inexpensively at any hardware store. 1 to 1&Acirc;&frac12; threads should be relieved this way to avoid having the top thread come out at high torque, but you should leave at least 3 threads for a good grip.</p>
<p>Note: If anyone has any more suggestions or a better technique please let me know.</p>
