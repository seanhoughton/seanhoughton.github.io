<p>After scanning in some of my old slides I decided to stack a couple of M8. &Acirc;&nbsp;This image is a total of 1.5 hours of exposure from 2001.</p>

<p>The Lagoon nebula is a bright nebula in the summer sky. &Acirc;&nbsp;It's easy to see with the naked eye if the sky is dark enough and its brightness makes it a relatively easy target for astrophotography. &Acirc;&nbsp;However, any tiny technical mistake shows up with exposures this long. &Acirc;&nbsp;If &Acirc;&nbsp;you look closely you can see the stars around the edge of the field are curving around. &Acirc;&nbsp;This is called field rotation and it happens if your telescope isn't perfectly aligned with the earths rotational axis.</p>
