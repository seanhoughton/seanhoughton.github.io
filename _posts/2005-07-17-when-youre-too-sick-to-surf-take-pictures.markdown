  I managed to injure my ankle and get pretty sick right when a large swell showed up in San Diego.  The weather was awesome so all I could get was vicarious surfage.

<h2>The Ocean Beach Pier</h2><br />
I've never surfed here.  It looks like a narrow break with some nasty rocks and pier poles to watch out for.<br />

<h2>Sunset Cliffs</h2><br />
This place was crowded.  There were tons of surfers and even more sightseers.  There was a distant break where most of the longboarders were, and a beach break with these shortboards.
