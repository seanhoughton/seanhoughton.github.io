After almost two years of work the Transformers: War for Cybertron game is finally done and the demo is available for download.  I had to rewrite some of the code in our data collection system* because so many people are playing!

So far the reception has been really good.  The demo currently has a 4.5 / 5 star rating and the forums seem to be filled with positive comments.
